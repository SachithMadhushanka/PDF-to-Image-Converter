# PDF to Image Converter

This Python application allows users to convert PDF files into image files (PNG format). The application utilizes the `fitz` library for PDF processing and `tkinter` for the graphical user interface. Upon launching the application, users are prompted to select a PDF file. Once a file is selected, users can initiate the conversion process, which extracts each page from the PDF and saves it as a separate PNG image file. The application provides error handling for cases such as invalid file selections or conversion failures. Users are notified upon successful completion of the conversion process. The progress of the conversion is displayed in the title bar of the application window.
